# About Wix Business Phone Numbers

With Wix Business Phone Numbers, site owners can get a dedicated virtual business phone number so they can keep their personal number private.

The Wix Business Phone Numbers service consists of two main sub-services: Business Phone Manager and Business Phone Switchboard.

The Business Phone Manager APIs let site owners:

- Specify agents to make or receive calls through the business phone
- Set call forwarding schedules, voicemail greetings, and communication channels for each agent
- Configure the system voicemail greeting

The Business Phone Switchboard APIs let users:

- Make outgoing calls
- Send text messages through the business phone number.
