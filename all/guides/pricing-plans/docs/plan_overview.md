# Plan

## What is a Pricing Plan?
The Plan API includes all the details of plans from Pricing Plans and allows to manage pricing plans definitions.

## Pricing Plan types
- Free plan.
- One-time plan - the member is charged once. 
These plans can be set to expire or continue indefinitely until the user cancels the subscription.
- Recurring plan - the member is charged in predefined intervals (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly). 
These plans can be set to expire or continue indefinitely until the user cancels the subscription. 
Recurring plans can also have free trial days.

## Free trial plans
Plan can be set to have free trial days (plan's attribute *freeTrialDays*).

During free trial days members can cancel the plan and he/she won’t be charged.

Free trial days are only applied once for a member for a plan (i.e. if a plan with the free trial was purchased once, the second time the member purchases it the free trial days won’t be applied, meaning the member will be charged for the plan right away).

## Plan's purchase limitation
Some plans can be purchased only a limited amount of times by a single member (plan's attribute *purchaseLimitations*). 

If the plan was updated, the limit is checked by the current plan details - e.g. a plan purchase limit was set to 1 and the member purchased the plan. 
If later the limit was updated to 2, the member can still purchase the same plan for a second time.

## Slug attribute
Slug is used for [Corvid By Wix](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/GettingStarted.html) to support [Dynamic Pages](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-dataset.DynamicDataset.html#loadPage). 

Slug is generated on plan's creation and updated on plan's update by its name. 
E.g. if the plan's name is "Test Plan" generated slug will be "test-plan". 
If there already exists a plan with a slug "test-plan" for the site, number will be added to it - i.e. slug will be "test-plan-1". 

## When does a plan expire?
The site owner can determine how long the plan will be active from the date of purchase. The active period is established 
in the same intervals as the payment periods only (weeks, months, years). The site owner may also create plans that 
never expire (i.e. the plan continues indefinitely until the user cancels). This is true for both One-time and Recurring plans.
