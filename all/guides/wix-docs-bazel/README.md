## ABOUT

Guilder is an internal service for Guild week management.
Once registered, Guilder will run weekly and send calendar invitations to the upcoming guild week participants, 
based on your own Guild week placement document. 

It also sends an email reminder, for every participant few days before the guild week starts and opens a slack channel for the relevant participants.

To Register:

Create Your own "Guild Week placement spreadsheet" - [How to create this spreadsheet](https://github.com/wix-private/automation-web-services/blob/master/guilder/CreatingSpreadsheet.md)
