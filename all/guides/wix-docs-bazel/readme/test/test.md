> Note: 
> It’s up to the Verticals to "protect" the users in regards to statuses of items being promoted in coupons. 
> For example, in stores, we don’t want to allow users make a product invisible, if it has a coupon attached to it. We added a logic that whenever a product is changed to invisible, we check if it has coupons attached, and if it does, we don’t allow to change to invisible ("One or more of these products has a promotion attached to it. You should close the promotion before you can set the product as Hidden.)
