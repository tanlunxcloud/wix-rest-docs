# About This API

With TXT file server, site owners can manage which pages of their website can be crawled by search engines and which authorized digital seller can sell the inventory. This will increase privacy, and transparency.

Using the TXT File server APIs you can get and update the following two files:

## **ads.txt** 
Ensure that your digital ad inventory is only sold through sellers (such as AdSense) who you've identified as authorized.

Example: [www.example.com/ads.txt](https://www.wa-site-builder-5f0de58e-dc43-4b7c-a616-d55f5ea434c7.org/ads.txt?petri_ovr=specs.EnableAdsReader:B)
